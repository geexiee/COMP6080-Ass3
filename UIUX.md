Considerations to improve UI/UX 
- Using material-ui's buttons allowed us to keep to a simple colour palette.
- Keeping in mind the user, the most commonly used navigation items are reachable from the navigation bar - the Dashboard and Join Game.
- Additionally, if the user is logged in and refreshes the page, they will remain logged in. This saves them the annoyance and extra effort of typing out their authentication details again.
- Also with the user in mind, the actions which can be performed all follow a streamlined storyboard flow which was produced from a mockup.
- Visual hierarchy implemented in the Start Game modal -> Game code is the largest text within the popup modal, with much space around it, which brings the user's attention to the information. A tooltip is also implemented on the Copy to Clipboard function, informing the user of its' function.
- While players are playing the game, buttons change colour to indicate whether or not they have been selected.
